# Abstraction
Understanding the concept of Abstraction in Java with examples


Abstraction is an OOP principle that hides implementation details and only shows essential features to the user. It helps reduce complexity and increases reusability.

How to Achieve Abstraction in Java?
Abstract Classes (Partial Abstraction)

Interfaces (100% Abstraction)

1️⃣ Abstract Class (Partial Abstraction)
Declared using abstract keyword.

Can have both abstract (without body) and concrete methods (with body).

Cannot be instantiated directly.

2️⃣ Interface (100% Abstraction)
Only contains abstract methods (before Java 8).

From Java 8, it can have default and static methods with implementation.

Achieves multiple inheritance.
